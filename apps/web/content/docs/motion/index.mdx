title: Introduction  
description: An ongoing experiment in UI, motion, and interface ergonomics.  
---

**ui/topia** is my personal sandbox — a place to play with [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/), [motion.dev](https://motion.dev/), and the little details that make interfaces feel alive.  
Nothing official here — just work in progress, shared as I go.

At its core, it’s a collection of React components built on **Base UI** and styled with **Tailwind**. You can copy them, tweak them, or tear them apart.

I love Base UI’s philosophy: solid, accessible primitives without any visual baggage. This project builds on that — giving those barebones components a bit of personality, polish, and motion.

## How It Works

No packages. No installs. Just source code you can make your own.  
The idea’s borrowed from **shadcn/ui** — own your code, understand it, bend it to your needs.

- **No black boxes:** you see every line.  
- **Edit freely:** it’s yours once copied.  
- **Learn by building:** I sure am.

## Why Base UI

If you’ve used **shadcn/ui** (built on Radix), this will feel familiar.  
I chose **Base UI** just fits how I think — it does the heavy lifting for a11y and interaction, but stays quiet on design.
that gives me room to shape things my way.

## Primitives, Blocks, and Motion

At the bottom: **Primitives** — unstyled, accessible building blocks.  
On top: **Blocks** — sign-in flows, sidebars, whatever I need next.  
Then there’s **Motion Playground** — microinteractions and transitions built with **motion.dev** (formerly Framer Motion).

Different layers for different moods:

- **Primitives** → barebone foundation  
- **Blocks** → structured UI patterns  
- **Motions** → movement and feedback  

Pick your layer, remix as needed.

## Built for Humans (and maybe AI)

Every component’s written to be clear, readable, and predictable — good for you, and for any AI that might want to help you refactor someday.
