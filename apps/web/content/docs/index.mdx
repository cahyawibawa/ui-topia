This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components and elements that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

## Motivation

The motivation behind ui/topia is simple: creating a digital haven where the incredible UI elements I've encountered can convene and thrive together. Imagine it as a cozy corner on the web—a virtual couch where designers and developers can gather, exchange ideas, and discover inspiration for their next project.

As someone who spends way too much time surfing the digital waves, I've seen some seriously awesome design work scattered across the internet. But I couldn't shake the feeling that it would be even better if all these amazing UI components had a place to call home—a place where they could mingle and collaborate.

{/* With the rise in popularity of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), I've noticed a growing interest among many individuals in creating their own UI websites. Therefore, I've compiled a list of the websites I've discovered. You can check them out here [resources](/docs/resources). */}
