## What is ui/topia?

**ui/topia** isn’t just a component library (yet)—it’s my personal playground for:

- Exploring design with [motion](https://motion.dev) and interactivity.
- Recreating and collecting UI ideas that inspire me.
- Refining documentation writing skills.
- Working towards becoming a Design Engineer.

## Motivation

**ui/topia** was created to be a space where unique and accessible UI components could inspire creativity. It’s designed to help designers and developers find ideas and solutions for their projects.  
This project draws inspiration from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui), [origin/ui](https://originui.com), [motion primitives](https://motion-primitives.com), [magic ui](https://magicui.design), and other well-known libraries.
