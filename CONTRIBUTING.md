## About the Repository

This is a **monorepo** powered by:  
- **[bun](https://bun.sh/)** for development.  
- **[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)** for efficient builds.

We use a **registry system** for organizing and exporting components. The source code for components is located in `packages/ui/registry/index.ts`, and they are categorized by type. All components are **ESM-only** and distributed via the registry.

To add a new component to ui/topia, you will need to modify several files. Follow these steps:


### 1. Create the Component

Create your components in `packages/src/components/showcases/your-component.tsx`

```typescript
import { Button, Stack } from '@/components/shadcn-ui';
import type { JSX } from 'react';

export default function Component(): JSX.Element { //make sure set to default
  return (
    <Stack
      align="start"
      direction={{ sm: 'column', md: 'row' }}
      gap={4}
      justify="space-between"
    >
      <Button size="small">Upload</Button>
      <Button>Upload</Button>
      <Button size="large">Upload</Button>
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

### 2. Update Registry

Export your component in the registry in `packages/src/ui/registry`

```typescript

const example: Registry = {
  'example-component-demo': {
    name: 'example-component',
    type: 'components:example',
   files: ["./components/examples/example-component.tsx"],
    component: React.lazy(() => import("./components/examples/example-component"))-
  },
}
```

### 3. Create docs

Create an MDX file for documenting your component in `content/docs/components/your-component.mdx`


That's it! You have successfully added a new component.
